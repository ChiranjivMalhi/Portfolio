        <p>
          Hi! I&apos;m a final-year student at Thapar Institute of Engineering and Technology, pursuing computer science engineering. My interests span across 3D design, game development, and technology innovation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Iâ€™m passionate about creating visually compelling environments, characters, and game assets, continuously exploring new techniques and tools to bring my artistic visions to life.
        </p>
        <p>
          My work ranges from highly detailed cinematic scenes to game-ready assets, utilizing software such as Maya, Unreal Engine, Substance Painter, Designer, and ZBrush. I focus on delivering high-quality art that tells stories in unique ways.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was also a runner-up in Google Code-in 2019, which sparked my journey into development and design.
        </p>
        <p>
          Feel free to download my resume to learn more about my projects, and let&apos;s connect for potential collaborations!
